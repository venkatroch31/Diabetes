  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <h4> What is Diabetes?</h4>
  <p>  Diabetes is a disease which occurs when the blood glucose level becomes high, 
    which ultimately leads to other health problems such as heart diseases, kidney disease etc. 
    Diabetes is caused mainly due to the consumption of highly processed food, bad consumption habits etc.
    According to WHO, the number of people with diabetes has been increased over the years. 
  </p>
  <p>The Pima are a group of Native Americans living in Arizona. 
    A genetic predisposition allowed this group to survive normally to a diet poor of carbohydrates for years. 
    In the recent years, because of a sudden shift from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, 
    together with a decline in physical activity, made them develop the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
    and for this reason they have been subject of many studies. The dataset having:
    <ul>
         <li>Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant</li>
         <li>Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test</li>
         <li>BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)</li>
         <li>SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)</li>
          <li>Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)</li>
          <li>BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)</li>
          <li>DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function</li>
          <li>Age: Age (years)</li>
          <li>Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)</li>
      </ul>
